# 🧠 Machine Learning Competition Repository

This repository contains my solutions for a Kaggle-based academic machine learning competition. It includes complete pipelines for multiple tasks using real and synthetic datasets.

## 📁 Contents

- `train.csv` – Main competition dataset
- `train2.csv`, `train3.csv`, `train5.csv` – Additional datasets
- `midterm1/` – First midterm task with synthetic data
- `midterm2/` – Second midterm task with synthetic data
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for experiments and final models

## 🧪 Tasks Covered

- ✅ Binary Classification  
- ✅ Multiclass Classification  
- ✅ Regression  
- ✅ Midterm projects with synthetic/random datasets

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python, NumPy, pandas  
- scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost  
- Optuna for hyperparameter tuning  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

## 📊 Evaluation

- Metrics: ROC AUC, RMSE, Accuracy  
- Validation: Stratified K-Fold & CV

## 📈 Goal

Final ranking based on the average of private leaderboard scores across all tasks.
